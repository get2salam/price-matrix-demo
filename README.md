## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 18
- **npm** ≥ 9

### Install & Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/get2salam/price-matrix-demo.git
cd price-matrix-demo

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at **http://localhost:5173**.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview   # preview the production build locally
```

### Docker

```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker compose up --build

# Or manually
docker build -t price-matrix-optimizer .
docker run -p 8080:80 price-matrix-optimizer
```

The containerized app serves on **http://localhost:8080**.

## 📖 How It Works

1. **Define your price matrix** — Set cost-range tiers (e.g. $0–$1.50, $1.51–$6.00, …) with target multipliers and gross profit percentages.

2. **Upload sales data** — Import a CSV export from your shop management system. The parser auto-detects header rows and handles currency-formatted values (`$1,234.56`).

3. **Set a profit target** — Choose between percentage growth, target margin, or a fixed dollar increase.

4. **Receive recommendations** — The optimizer distributes price adjustments across tiers using a weighted algorithm:
   - **60% volume weight** — Tiers with higher revenue share receive proportionally larger adjustments (bigger impact).
   - **40% headroom weight** — Tiers with lower current margins get more room to increase without hitting price sensitivity.
   - **Safety caps** — No tier increases more than 50%, and gross profit is capped at 95%.
   - **Convergence loop** — An iterative solver nudges multipliers until projected profit matches the target (within 0.5% tolerance).

5. **Fine-tune & export** — Manually override any tier's multiplier; the optimizer redistributes the remaining tiers to still hit your target. Export the final matrix as CSV, a printable report, or copy directly to your clipboard.
